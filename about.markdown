and Oracle
- Django, Rails, Backbone, Akka, and Spray
- docker, Kubernetes, QEMU, and Vagrant

I practice agile methods; emergent design and evolutionary
architecture; test-first TDD; loose coupling; inversion of control and
dependency injection; and code kata.

#### Experience

##### Technical Leader -- Cisco Systems, San Jose, California (2016-present)

_Tech: Go, Python, REST; AWS S3, Cloudwatch, DynamoDB, Route53,
Athena, Quicksight, IAM, SQS; DNS, SSH; Kubernetes, Docker, QEMU,
Vagrant; Terraform, Ansible, IPMI; Drone, TravisCI, Jenkins;
PagerDuty; OSX, Alpine linux, Windows_

Technical lead for design and implementation of the Billing
platform, a microservices architecture running the billing and usage
reporting functions for a private-cloud platform of
highly-available globally-distributed cloud-computing primitives.  The
central billing service is a REST API implemented in Go running on
Kubernetes clusters of Docker containers in geographically distributed
datacenters with HA latency-based DNS routing for widely dispersed
operators and consumers of platform services.  The service is responsible
for authorizing charges against platform accounts by issuing signed JWT
tokens to authenticated users.  Platform service providers report billable
customer usage to billing service endpoints, which is then aggregated
into account statements using infrastructure running as Lambda
functions in AWS and generating artifacts to S3 with monitoring and
reporting infrastructure implemented in Athena and QuickSight and
monitoring in Cloudwatch with PagerDuty integrations.  I executed the
initial implementation working solo, and then built and led a
geographically-distributed team across Europe and North and Central
America which continues to iterate on the platform and operate it in
production for the past two years.

When I joined the OpenDNS/Umbrella group at Cisco, I first worked on
the devops team responsible for the bare metal fleet spanning 70 DCs 
globally.  It was an ops-heavy team in need of balance on
the dev side, and I was able to pick up a lot of ops expertise from my
colleagues while also sharing with them about design and development
best practices, and test-first TDD.  I built an API for lifecycle
management of QEMU VMs on thousands of blades.  I led the initiative within the
team to build a system in Go to manage the lifecycle of those
bare-metal hosts from initial datacenter uplift to life-cycle
management from paving to patching to decommissioning, from PXE boot
to OS installation to integration with the fleet.

##### VP of Engineering -- Trip30.com, Boulder, Colorado (2013-2016)

Goland; Heroku; AWS EC2, Route 53, S3, Lambda; eXtreme Programming_

Designed, staffed, and implemented Trip30, giving travel industry
suppliers insight into the needs of individual travelers while
providing travelers a comprehensive view of the geographical and
temporal aspects of their planned and completed travel. Trip30 is
implemented as a JavaScript, HTML, and HTML5 single-page app written
with CoffeeScript and Backbone as a client of a Rails API running in
Heroku with datastores in PostgreSQL and edis and live  reporting and
analytics functions implemented using Websockets as a client of

As a senior devops software engineer, I built and administered
PCI-compliant infrastructure running on EC2 for payment processing and
remote management of minuteKEY's network of self-service kiosks
deployed in thousands of big box stores across North America. The
management platform is implemented in Scala with Akka and Spray and
datastores in PostgreSQL and MongoDB and is used for remote management
over SSH and VNC of remote kiosks running Cygwin virtual hosts on
Windows PCs which control the UI and the internal camera, and operate
the key-handling robot.


##### Director of Software Development -- Alpine Access U, Denver, Colorado (2009-2011)

_Tech: CentOS, OSX; Python, JavaScript; MySQL; memcached; Django; AWS
EC2, S3; Scrum_

Alpine Access is a home-shoring virtual call center, which recruits
tens of thousands of agents per year through Alpine Access U. I
recruited, hired, and led the engineering team in developing the
Alpine Recruiting Platform, a Django web application running in
multiple EC2 zones with state-sharing across zones via memcached,
supporting complex business processes for recruiting new agents, from
initial contact through completed onboarding; and Elmer, a Django
learning management system running on multiple EC2 zones. This system
delivers training to new agents, tracks their progress through
training, and maintains training records data for tens of thousands of
agents.
