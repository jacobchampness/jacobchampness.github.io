<h5 id="technical-leader--cisco-systems-san-jose-california-2016-present">Technical Leader – Cisco Systems, San Jose, California (2016-present)</h5>

<p><em>Tech: Go, Python, REST; AWS S3, Cloudwatch, DynamoDB, Route53,
Athena, Quicksight, IAM, SQS; DNS, SSH; Kubernetes, Docker, QEMU,
Vagrant; Terraform, Ansible, IPMI; Drone, TravisCI, Jenkins;
PagerDuty; OSX, Alpine linux, Windows</em></p>

<p>Technical lead for design and implementation of the Billing
platform, a microservices architecture running the billing and usage
reporting functions for a private-cloud platform of
highly-available globally-distributed cloud-computing primitives.  The
central billing service is a REST API implemented in Go running on
Kubernetes clusters of Docker containers in geographically distributed
datacenters with HA latency-based DNS routing for widely dispersed
operators and consumers of platform services.  The service is responsible
for authorizing charges against platform accounts by issuing signed JWT
tokens to authenticated users.  Platform service providers report billable
customer usage to billing service endpoints, which is then aggregated
into account statements using infrastructure running as Lambda
functions in AWS and generating artifacts to S3 with 
reporting infrastructure implemented in Athena and QuickSight and
monitoring in Cloudwatch and PagerDuty.  I executed the
initial implementation working solo, and then built and led a
geographically-distributed team across Europe and North 
America which continues to iterate on the platform and operate it in
production.</p>

<p>When I joined the OpenDNS/Umbrella at Cisco, I first worked on
the devops team responsible for the bare metal fleet spanning 70 DCs 
globally.  It was an ops-heavy team in need of balance on
the dev side, and I was able to pick up a lot of ops expertise from my
colleagues while also sharing with them about design and development
best practices, and test-first TDD.  I built an API for lifecycle
management of QEMU VMs on thousands of blades.  I led the initiative within the
team to build a system in Go to manage the lifecycle of those
bare-metal hosts from initial datacenter uplift to life-cycle
management from paving to patching to decommissioning, from PXE boot
to OS installation to integration with the fleet.</p>
